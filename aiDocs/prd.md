## Problem statement

Tech recruiters and engineering hiring managers screening developer candidates in 2026 face near-identical portfolios — GitHub dumps, tutorial clones, and flashy sites that say nothing useful about how a developer thinks or delivers. Recruiters spend 60 seconds or less before moving on; most portfolios impress peers, not screeners.

This portfolio answers three questions in under a minute: _Can this person ship? Can they think? Can they communicate?_ — while sounding like a real person, not a LinkedIn summary.

## Product strategy

**Dual audience, one visit:**

| Audience                        | Needs                                    | How the site delivers                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recruiters (primary)**        | Role, stack, demos, GitHub, fast contact | Scannable project cards, hero copy with domain/stack signal, contact and resume reachable |
| **Hiring managers (secondary)** | Depth, judgment, repos                   | Problem/Solution on cards; optional case study pages when relevant context is available   |
| **Anyone reading for you**      | Genuine voice, memorable background      | Hero copy, about narrative, chronological timeline                                        |

**Link tiers** (content priority — not layout prescription):

- **Primary (hire/collaborate):** Email, LinkedIn, Resume — `person.email`, `person.resume`, `presence.linkedin`
- **Secondary (public presence):** GitHub, Substack — `presence.github`, `presence.substack`

Long-form writing stays on Substack (link out only). No on-site blog or post mirroring.

**Content maintenance:** All copy and facts live in **`profile.json`**. The site will use derived code modules at build time to type and expose that data to components — those modules are not hand-edited content sources. Agents must not edit `profile.json`.

## Target users

### Primary: Tech recruiter (screener)

- Spends 30–90 seconds; checks headline clarity, projects, demos, GitHub
- **Success:** Reaches out or passes profile to a hiring manager with confidence

### Secondary: Engineering hiring manager

- Spends 3–10 minutes; reads project detail, skims repos, looks for production thinking
- **Success:** Enough signal for an interview decision without a take-home

### Not for

- Freelance client acquisition, passive content marketing, portfolio design awards

---

## Goals and success metrics

### Primary goal

Convert recruiter visits into first-round interview requests — with copy that also reads as genuinely human.

### Hard validation — cold-read test

Before sharing with recruiters:

- Share URL with 3 contacts without context
- Ask: _"After 60 seconds, what do I do and which project stood out?"_
- **Pass:** All 3 describe **role/stack/domain**, name **one project**, find **demo or GitHub** without prompting
- **Fail:** Generic description or no project named → revise hero or project framing and retest

### Soft guidelines (spot-check, not pass/fail)

- Copy sounds human when read aloud
- Site is easy to read and navigate
- No large walls of text
- Avoid em-dashes

### Quantitative metrics (optional — when analytics added)

| Metric             | Target              | Notes           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Demo click-through | ≥ 50% of card views | Link events     |
| GitHub engagement  | ≥ 30% of sessions   | Outbound clicks |
| LCP (mobile)       | < 1.5s              | PageSpeed       |
| Mobile usability   | Readable on phone   | Manual QA       |

Not required for launch. Track after deploy if useful.

## Anti-pattern guardrails

Hard disqualifiers — fix before public recruiter sharing:

| Anti-pattern                       | Launch gate                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tutorial/clone featured projects   | Zero in featured set                                                                        |
| Broken demo links                  | Every demo resolves in < 3s; no unhandled errors                                            |
| Single "initial commit" repo dumps | ≥ 15 commits, ≥ 3 named commits in top 10, ≥ 2 weeks span                                   |
| Portfolio site as featured project | Not in project section                                                                      |
| Unclear individual contribution    | Explicit on collaborative projects                                                          |
| Technology tourism                 | Featured projects should read as a coherent professional story, not unrelated stack hopping |
| Abandoned public GitHub repos      | Archive/delete repos with < 5 commits or no README                                          |

## Site story architecture

The site tells one story in four content beats. **Layout is flexible** — single scroll, multiple pages, or a mix. Visual design should be professional and distinctive; preserve each project's existing style when refactoring.

**Hook → Story → Projects → Contact**

| Beat     | Content from `profile.json`                                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hook     | `hero.contrastLead`, `hero.professionalSentence`, `person.name`                              |
| Story    | `about.paragraphs`, `about.heading`, `timeline`                                              |
| Projects | All entries where `featured: true` — Problem, Solution, stack, outbound links                |
| Contact  | `person.resume`, `person.email`, `presence.linkedin`, `presence.github`, `presence.substack` |

Navigation labels and page structure may vary by design.

## Key features

### Must have

**1. Hero (Hook)**

- `hero.contrastLead` and `hero.professionalSentence` rendered on the site
- Professional sentence signals **role, domain, and stack** — not generic

**2. Story**

- `about.paragraphs` and `about.heading` available on the site
- `timeline` as a chronological list — credentials interleaved with human details

**3. Featured projects**

- All projects with `featured: true` in `profile.json` (count is dynamic)
- Each card shows **Problem** and **Solution** (sourced from `objective` and `tradeOff` in JSON)
- Stack tags per project
- Live demo and GitHub links when URLs are set in `profile.json`

**4. Contact and links**

- Resume PDF reachable from the site
- Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Substack links reachable without hunting (`person.email`, `person.resume`, `presence.*`)
- No contact forms

**5. Stack and deploy**

- Astro static site, Tailwind v4, deployed to GitHub Pages
- Working demos where `demoUrl` is provided

**6. Mobile-readable**

- Usable on a phone; no horizontal scroll; readable type

### Nice to have

- Case study pages with real depth — only when sufficient content exists; never hallucinate
- `handshakeLine` surfaced on the site
- JSON-LD, sitemap, `robots.txt`, canonicals, OG/Twitter meta, `llms.txt`
- Privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible/Fathom)
- One technical blog post on Substack (not mirrored on-site)
- Hidden creative easter-egg page (`noindex`, excluded from sitemap)
